<h1> Pong-game </h1>

This is a basic implementation of the Atari Pong game, but it's missing a few things intentionally and they're left as further exploration for the reader.

<h1>Further Exploration</h1>

<h2>Score</h2>

When a ball goes past a paddle, the other player should score a point. Use context.fillText() to display the score to the screen
Mobile and touchscreen support
Allow the game to be scaled down to a phone size. See https://codepen.io/straker/pen/VazMaL
Support touch controls

Ball trajectory

The ball should change trajectory based on where it hit the paddle. For example, if it hit the topmost part of the paddle it should have a sharp angle upward, whereas if it hit the direct middle of the paddle it should move completely flat towards the other payer.
Important note: I will answer questions about the code but will not add more features or answer questions about adding more features. This series is meant to give a basic outline of the game but nothing more.
